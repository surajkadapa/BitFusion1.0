This is BitFusion 1.0, a simple 16-bit process VM based on the LC-3 architecture.
This project started of as an assignment for my Data Strucutures class in my university. This a project in a long running series of Virtual Machines where each one will increase in complexity.
This VM differs from traditional VMs by running only the process it is emulating rather than emulating the whole system like System VMs do.
